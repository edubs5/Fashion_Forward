Hi.

Fashion Forward is an Overflow for fashion advice.  The idea is users will ask questions about their outfit by
posting a link from imgur.  Logged in uses can vote, "You are jammin'!" or "Clean your mirror!" to offer advice
on the question poster's fashion choice.

Users>>Questions>>Answers.

We have test coverage of about half our tests.  Users show page is failing.  Questions having many answers is failing.

We need user sessions complete and an answers controller.
